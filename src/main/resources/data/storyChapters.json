  "7": "PLACENAME? I never heard of it.\nSounds nice!\n\nWell... Let us get back to the story I was going to tell you.\n\n500 years ago, there was once an abbey on the foot of the hill in a place called PLACE NAME .\nThe place wasn.t important to anything or to anyone.\nIt wasn't beautiful nor rich nor famous for people to go there.\nEven the people living there didn't care about what happened to their home.\n\nThey had a job to attend to, shared a nice meal every evening with their families\nand that was what got them through the day.\nFATHER NAME + was the brewer of + PLACE NAME + , he and his beer were famous.\nSadly, his beer didn't make him immortal and he just died when PLAYER NAME, his only DAUGHTER/SON was born.\n\nPeople forgot the once dearly known brewer and the taste of his legacy.\n\nYears go by and little PLAYER NAME grows older.\nOne day SHE/HE finds a book on a dusty shelf.\nIt was a journal of HER/HIS father SHE/HE only knows by memories told by people.\nThe journal told about the fame and glory of FATHER NAME brews and even a little clue about a recipe he hid from the world when he knew his last day would come.\n\nAfter PLAYER NAME discovered this, SHE/HE was intrigued by his tale asked Mother to tell more.\n\nShe confirmed everything like a caught murderer confesses his crimes\nbut she didn't know anything about the secret recipe and where it could be hidden.\n\nShe only knew that her husband spent a lot of time in the silent abbey located in the mountains.\n\n\"Maybe the recipe is hidden within the abbey?\" + PLAYER NAME + wondered.\n\nThe next morning + SHE/HE + packed + HER/HIS + bags and left home determined to find the abbey.\n\nAfter buying some supplies on the marketplace, + SHE/HE + started to head out to the border of centre of + PLACE NAME + .\nThe path within the mountains was steep and even a bit dangerous because of snow that hid the steps.\nWith every step + SHE/HE + took, + HER/HIS + heartbeat went up a little.\n\nThe walk takes a half a day if I remember correctly.\n\nThe first looks were a little bit frightening.\nMoss covered the big beams which hold the big wooden gate.\nWater of a little creek runs under the drawbridge.\n\nAfter grasping the moment of arriving to the moment of truth, + PLAYER NAME +  heard the gate opening.\nA man approached.\n\nTimid as he was, he said: 'Welcome traveller. What brings you here?\nBefore the + GIRL/BOY + could say anything, the man had a better look at the unexpected visitor.\n'It's you! You are the + DAUGHTER/SON + of + FATHER NAME + said the man.\n'I'm abbot ABBOT NAME, your father was a great friend. Come in! It's not safe at night here.\nWolves are always lurking for our chickens.\n\nSo, the GIRL/BOY follows the abbot inside.\nAs the path leads the way to the abbey, the gate closes silently behind them.\n\n'You want to know more about your father, correct?': said the abbot.\nPLAYER NAME nodded.\n\nThe big door opened of the abbey when they arrived the main hall of the building.\nFumes of a fireplace and its light escaped through the entrance.\n\nAfter a humble dinner together with the other monks.\nPLAYER NAME was given a small bedroom.\n\nBefore the abbot left of to his own room, he said: Tomorrow I'll tell you the story of your father and I.'\n\nHE/SHE + couldn't sleep that night.\nIt could be the night where a whole part of HER/HIS life.",
  "8": ",Your father and I had some common interests, the abbot told.\n'I had a small stall with spices, potions and other trinkets on the market of + PLACENAME + .\nThat is 20 years ago.\n\nYour father sought me out, like I picked rosemary in the forest.\nHe said he needed knowledge about some herbs.\nI asked him why. And he said he was experimenting to find a new way of brewing.\nFATHER NAME wanted to brew a beer worth fighting for, a beer that wields power, making a difference in the world.\n\nI was just an young monk in the abbey, with somewhat experience in botanology\nbut I felt like I had to help him. So, I did.\n\nWe reorganized the inner garden of the abbey. Sat together for hours in dozens of nights, just to find the right ingredient for the beer that would make such a difference.\nThe brewery you can find here, was also built in those days. We transformed together with my brothers this abbey into a true brewery, capable of doing anything.\n\nEven though... Months went by, we had hundreds of failed batches, maybe even more and we still didn't make what satisfied our expectations.\n\nUntil one day, a smell came out of the brewery's chimney.\nThe clouded sky opened, the sun started to shine upon the claystone of courtyard where we were sitting.\nApparently, the smell got carried away with the wind into the centre of PLACE NAME.\n\nSuddenly a lot of people from the centre came to visit our humble abbey to ask where that smell came from.\nWe both saw what happened, we may have found the recipe that your father was looking for.\n\nThat night we celebrated. We made it.\nFinally, our prayers were answered, our demands were heard and filled.\n\nWe wrote the recipe down, we put a scheme together of all the steps we took to make the beer.\nI insisted that your father would be the sole owner of the recipe.\nEven though I trusted every brother in my abbey with my life, this was more important.\n\nAfter 4 days, a man approached the abbey.\nHe said he was a servant of the king himself.\nIt appeared that the king's nose caught the smell as well.\nThe king demanded that we could brew this beer for him and only for him.\n\nIn that way he could overrule his opponents in battles.\n\nWe didn't believe that the beer could such a power.\nIn any case, we weren't eager to accept such a deal because we were afraid that such a power, if our brew would give such a power, could have a bad outcome.\n\nAfter we told the man, we couldn't cooperate with them, your father headed immediately for the forest to hide the recipe there.\n\nWe decided that such a secret could be dangerous.\nDoesn,'t matter the recipe was used in the future nor in the past.\nIt would be the secret of the mountains, your father said when he came back.\n\n1 day later, your father said goodbye.\nHe had received a letter from your mother, telling him that he got a + DAUGHTER/SON +.\n\nWord got out that when he wanted to enter PLACENAME. Some guards of the palace were waiting for him.\nThey took him out and your father was never to be heard of again.",
